Setup manager:

   * turn off everything but zernikes: that would be the correctionSelect param. subfields.
   * change zernike_coeff params to your liking
   * Manager > Prepare
   * new /tmp/asdata.txt appears!
   * example: moving from no zernike_coeff's to one coefficient (N1=100) will change the file from having all zeros in the third column to having numbers (-131 to -100).
   

File written:

   * in cmdPositionDep, which must be called in the Prepare (part of a scan as well presumably)
   * cmdPosition is array of hoop, rib, (int) position for each actuator
   * position is set here by:
      * adding up the corrections from each one selected in correctionSelect
      * for zernikes, that is 0 - ZernkikeModel->displacement(elevation, *loc)

ZernikeModel->displacement:
   * elevation is passed in but NOT USED!
   * phi, rho and theta for each actuaotr is in the ZernikeNode via the passed actuatorLocation 
   * displacement = phi * (zernike_coeff[z_index] * compute_zernike(z_index, rho, theta))
