# LASSI Data Analysis Package

We've started this repo to organize our first attempts at analyzing the 
data coming out of the Leica scanner we'll be using for the LASSI project.

## Installation

   * ./createEnv
   * source <username>_lassi_env/bin/activate

## Running the notebook

   * source <username>_lassi_env/bin/activate
   * edit ./runNotebook to replace the host you are on and the port you'd like to use
   * ./runNotebook
   * if your browser doesn't open up automatically, go to  http://<host>:<port>
   * open any of the notebooks you'd like to run
